# Pyber_Analysis

Using Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to visualize PyBer ride share data



## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project is to summarize and visualize ride share data for executive team review. PyBer segments its ride share services into 3 different city types: urban, suburban, and rural. We will analyze the relationships between these city types and the average number of drivers, rides, and fares. We will use visuals to make these relationships more easy to discover.

### Purpose

The intent of this analysis is to compile ride share data for urban, suburban and rural cities. The PyBer executive team is seeking to draw conclusions between city types and metrics such as total riders, driver count, and average fare. By discovering these relationships we anticipate to gain insights in how PyBer can better allocate its resources to improve profitability. 



## Results

Through reviewing our summary data frame, it is evident that there is great variation across each metric. Urban cities make up a large percentage of total rides and total drivers between all cities. However, once we review the other cities, it is apparent that Urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver compared to our other city types. Rural city types takes the top spot for both these metrics, and demonstrates a huge gap in the average fare per driver.

Continuing our analysis with the multiple_line chart we are able to see the total weekly fares per city from January 2019 - April 2019. Our first finding when reviewing this chart is the steep rise in demand in the 3rd week of February. The month of March was particularly interesting in regards to Suburban and Urban cities that experienced highly volatile demand trends. April was showed that demand for rides in Rural and Urban city types exhibited strong declines, but on the other hand Suburban cities faced a strong increase in demand for rides.

## Summary

There are three recommendations that we can draw from this analysis. Our first recommendation is that PyBer further investigate into increasing the supply of drivers to rural areas on the basis of increased average fares that could help PyBer become more profitable. Our next recommendation became evident when we witnessed the trend between the number of drivers and the average fare per ride. Taking this into account, we recommend that PyBer use this data to influence the number of drivers at given moments in order to maximize the average fare price. Our last recommendation comes from our line chart that showed a strong increase in demand in the month of April for Suburban areas, as opposed to the reduced demand seen in our other city types. We recommend that PyBer allocate more drivers to Suburban areas during this month to keep up with demand. Further recommendations could be made upon retrieving and analyzing more data. One recommendation for future analysis is to review data for average ride length per city type and cross reference it with average fare ride to gain a better understanding of pricing.
